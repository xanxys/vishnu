light transport equation provides constraints on plenoptic function in equiribrium state.
Real light propagation can be expressed as interaction of E-M fields w/ Maxwell's equation.
However, geometric optical light propagation is not present. 

2-dimensional case
$$
f(t,p,\theta) : R \times R^2 \times \Theta \rightarrow K
$$
where $\Theta$ is unit circle and \theta is unit vector

point light at p can be written as:
$$
\forall (t,\theta) . f(t,p,\theta)=\delta^2
$$

energy conservation of free space:
$$
\frac{d}{dt}\int_{R^2}\int_{\Theta} f(p,\theth) dp d\theta = 0
$$

energy conservation in free region $D$ and flow:
$$
\frac{d}{dt} \int_D\int_{\Theta} f(p,\theta) dp d\theta = c \int_{\delta D}\int_{\Theta} f(p,\theta)d_D(p,\theta) dp d\theta
$$
where $d_D(p,\theta)=\sgn (n_D(p) \dot \theta)$

energy conservation in certain direction:
$$
\forall \theta. \frac{d}{dt} \int_{R^2} f(p) dp = 0
$$
